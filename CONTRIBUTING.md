# How to contribute
Pre req: have NodeJs installed

* Clone `git clone` - downloads code onto your local machine
* run `npm install` -  installs dependencies
* run `npm build` - transpiles typescript to javascript as you edit the `.ts` files
* Do NOT edit the `.js` files in the `script` folder directly, as its generated for the `ts` folder and its files.
